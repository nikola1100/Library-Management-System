   cd library-management-system
   ```
2. Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`.

Database Setup:
1. Setup SQL Server & Database
Before running the project, make sure you have SQL Server installed. If you donâ€™t have it, you can use SQL Server Express or Azure SQL.

Open appsettings.json (or appsettings.Development.json) and add the connection string:

{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=OfficeDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
    }
}
Replace YOUR_SERVER with your SQL Server instance name.

Run the following Entity Framework Core commands to create the database:


dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
2. Install Dependencies
Run this in the terminal inside your project folder:


dotnet restore
3. Run the Project
Now start the project using:


dotnet run
Or if you're using Visual Studio, just press Ctrl + F5.

4. Test the API
Once the project is running, open a browser or use Postman to test the API endpoints:

GET all Books:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/Books
GET Books by ID:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/Books/{id}
POST new Books:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/Books
Body (JSON):

{
    "name": "Wheel Of Time",
    "Genre": "Fantasy",
    "Available Copies": 5
}
PUT update Books:
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/Books/{id}
DELETE a Book:
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/Book/{id}
